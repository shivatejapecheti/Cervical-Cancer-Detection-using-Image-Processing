# Cervical-Cancer-Detection-using-Image-Processing

## Objectives 

Following are the objectives which are monitored and accomplished in this work: 
+ To develop an automated system that enable proficient and effective detection of Cervical Cancer that can be implemented for commercial purpose. 
+ Making use of image processing toolboxes of MATLAB 
+ Pathologists can use this method as a decision support in detecting cancer. This will reduce the workload on clinicians and makes the diagnosis of cancer faster, economical and more accurate.
